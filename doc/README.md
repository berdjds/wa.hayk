# WAControl Documentation

WAControl is a web dashboard for managing WhatsApp Web sessions. It allows authenticated users to read and send WhatsApp messages, view chats, manage users, and monitor connection status through a browser-based interface.

## What is WAControl?

WAControl connects to WhatsApp Web using Puppeteer and the `whatsapp-web.js` library. An admin scans a QR code to authenticate the session, after which the application can:

- Receive incoming messages in real time.
- Send text, image, voice, and document messages.
- Persist chats and messages to a local SQLite database.
- Manage users and view audit logs from an admin panel.
